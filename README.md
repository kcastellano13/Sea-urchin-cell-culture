### The raw single cell RNA-sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing data associated with this project are affiliated with NCBI BioProject PRJNA1109820

## Validating the identity of the cells in culture using 16S rDNA PCR and 18S rDNA targeted amplicon sequencing
The cell pellets used for identification include:
        TABLE

- DNA was extracted following a modified CTAB extraction procedure (please reference publication for additional information).
- Amplification of 18S rDNA was conducted with the following primers: F:GCTTGTCTCAAAGATTAAGCC, R: GCCTGCTGCTGCCTTCCTTGGA (Blaxter et al., 1998)
- Samples were sequenced on an Illumina Miseq using a xxxxxx kit
- Bioinformatic analysis of the data can be found in the 01_Amplicon_Sequencing folder above

Extraction and sequencing was performed by Kate Castellano and Reanna McAtee

## Single-cell RNA sequencing 
Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on cells:
        TABLE

- 10,000 cells from each condition were prepared with the 10x Genomic Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' v3.1 protocol following the manufacturer’s instructions
- Single cell cDNA and libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3 Chemistry.
- Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with the SP 200 cycle kit, v1.5
- Bioinformatic analysis of the data can be found in the XXX folder above

Single cell extraction, library preparation and analysis were performed by Kate Castellano
Single Cell sequencing was performed by the Center for Genome Innovation (CGI) at the University of connecticut

## mRNA Sequencing of whole cell cultures
Samples used for mRNA sequencing:
        TABLE
    
- RNA was extracted from each pellet using the RNeasy® Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions
- mRNA was prepared using the Truseq Stranded RNA sequencing kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000

RNA extraction and analysis were performed by Kate Castellano
